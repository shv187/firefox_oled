# firefox_oled
userChrome.css config I "made" to save my OLED display.

# Instructions
1. Use firefox
2. Go to `about:config` and make sure `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` is set to `true`
3. Find your firefox profile directory via `about:profiles`
4. Place the `userChrome.css` into `your_firefox_profile/chrome/` directory (you will probably have to create `chrome` directory yourself)
5. Have fun :)
